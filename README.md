# SFS Drogue Chutes
As the name suggests, this mod adds drogue chutes to the game.

## Important

  In order to be able to use these parts, you need to be on new Parts Loader beta (password to it is available at game's official Discord server).
  Also, as this pack is Steam-exclusive, it won't work on mobile (Mac version might work, but it's untested for a moment).
  
## About the mod

  Drogue chutes featured in this pack could deploy at 5 kilometers altitude and 500 m/s speed.
  
  They appear in Aerodynamics section, as well as their dedicated `N2O4's Parts` section where all my future content will go into.
  
## How to install
  
  From Releases section, download the `n2o4's drogue chutes` file. Then move that file to your game directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Spaceflight Simulator_Data\Custom Assets\Parts`). Launch the game, get into Build scene, and you should see new category appear (currently trying to move it between Engines and Aerodynamics, but I have no idea on how to do that, so it's first for a moment).
